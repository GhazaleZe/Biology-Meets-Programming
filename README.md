These files are for the fourth week :heart_eyes: :

- [RandomizedMotifSearch.py](FourthWeek/RandomizedMotifSearch.py)
- [Motif_Week4.py](FourthWeek/Motif_Week4.py)
- [Normalize.py](FourthWeek/Normalize.py)
- [RandomizedMotifSearch.py](FourthWeek/RandomizedMotifSearch.py)
- [ProfileGeneratedString.py](FourthWeek/ProfileGeneratedString.py)
- [RandomMotifs.py](FourthWeek/RandomMotifs.py)
- [GibbsSampler.py](FourthWeek/GibbsSampler.py)

### Some additional notes:

**Laplaceâ€™s Rule of Succession** is used for  **CountWithPseudocounts** function.   
**RandomizedMotifSearch** has the advantage of being able to find **longer motifs**.
