# Biology Meets Programming 

My codes of the Coursera's course named "Biology Meets Programming: Bioinformatics for Beginners"  are in this repository. 

These files are for the first week :blush: :

- hidden_messages_dictionary.py
- ReverseComplement.py 
- PatternMatching.py
- PatternInRegion.py

These files are for the second week :smile: :

- SymbolArray.py
- SkewArray.py
- HammingDistance.py
- ApproximatePatternMatching.py

These files are for the third week :grimacing: :

- Motifs.py  
- Consensus.py     
- Score.py      
- probability.py    
- ProfileMostProbablePattern.py    
- GreedyMotifSearch.py

These files are for the fourth week :heart_eyes: :

- RandomizedMotifSearch.py
- Motif_Week4.py
- Normalize.py
- RandomizedMotifSearch.py
- ProfileGeneratedString.py
- RandomMotifs.py
- GibbsSampler.py

### Some additional notes:

**Laplaceâ€™s Rule of Succession** is used for  **CountWithPseudocounts** function.   
**RandomizedMotifSearch** has the advantage of being able to find **longer motifs**.
